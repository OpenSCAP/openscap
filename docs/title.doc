SCAP is a line of standards managed by NIST with the goal of providing
a standard language for the expression of Computer Network Defense
related information.

/**

@defgroup COMMON Common

Definitions and functions common to all the OpenScap sublibraries.

@defgroup CPE

Common Platform Enumeration.

Supported version: 2.3 and lower

@defgroup CVE

Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures.

@defgroup CVSS

Common Vulnerability Scoring System.

Supported version: 2

@defgroup OVAL

Open Vulnerability and Assessment Language.

This layer covers interface to OVAL language. It provides easier way for
manipulation with OVAL Definition, OVAL System Characteristics and 
OVAL Result content. Content can be imported from XML file adjusted 
and exported back to the file. Besides this basic functionality, it also 
enables user to use system checking mechanism. This mechanism probe 
the OS and gather OVAL System characteristics that can be later used to
create OVAL Results.

Supported version: 5.10.1 and lower

OVAL Definition supported schemas: 

- Core - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5
- Common - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-common-5
- Independent - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5#independent
- Linux - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5#linux
- Unix - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5#unix

OVAL System Characteristics supported schemas: 

- Core - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-system-characteristics-5
- Common - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-common-5
- Independent - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-system-characteristics-5#independent
- Linux - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-system-characteristics-5#linux
- Unix - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-system-characteristics-5#unix

OVAL Results supported schemas:

- Core - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-results-5
- Common - http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-common-5

@defgroup XCCDF

Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format.

Supported version: 1.2 and lower

@defgroup XCCDF_POLICY

Policy interface to Extensible Configuration Checklist Description Format. 
Purpose of this layer is to separate the transport syntax of the XCCDF XML 
from the processes of evaluating and scoring the policy content comprised 
by the XCCDF documents. XCCDF Policy model performs the loading, evaluation 
and scoring tasks of XCCDF.
