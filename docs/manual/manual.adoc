== Introduction

This documentation provides information about a command-line tool called
 ```oscap``` and its most common operations.  With ```oscap``` you can check
security configuration settings of a system, and examine the system for signs of
a compromise by using rules based on standards and specifications. The
 ```oscap``` uses {scap}[SCAP] which is a line of specifications maintained by
the {nist}[NIST] which was created to provide a standardized approach for
maintaining system security. New specifications are governed by NIST's SCAP
http://scap.nist.gov/timeline.html[Release cycle] in order to provide a
consistent and repeatable revision workflow. The ```oscap``` mainly processes
the {xccdf}[XCCDF] which is a standard way of expressing a checklist content and
defines security checklists. It also combines with other specifications such as
{cpe}[CPE], {cce}[CCE] and {oval}[OVAL] to create a SCAP-expressed checklist that
can be processed by SCAP-validated products.  For more information about the
SCAP please refer to http://open-scap.org/features/standards/[SCAP Standards].

The ```oscap``` tool is a part of the {openscap_web}[OpenSCAP] project.  If you're
interested in a graphical alternative to this tool please visit
{workbench_url}[SCAP Workbench] page.


We will use the _scap-security-guide_ {ssg}[SSG] project to provide us the SCAP
content. It provides security policies written in a form of SCAP documents
covering many areas of computer security, and it implements security guidances
recommended by respected authorities, namely {pci_dss}[PCI DSS], {stig}[STIG], and
{usgcb}[USGCB].

You can also generate your own SCAP content if you have an understanding of at least
XCCDF or OVAL. XCCDF content is also frequently published online under open
source licenses, and you can customize this content to suit your needs instead.
SCAP Workbench is a great tool to do the customization.

The Basic oscap usage section of the manual presents how to install the tool
and SCAP content and how to use those to examine a SCAP content, perform a
configuration scan or how to automatically remediate your machines.

Third section provides cover advanced topic like validation, signing and
transformation of SCAP content, generating reports and guides and also some
information about CPE applicability.

Last section contains information about debuging and compiling oscap on Linux
and Windows which can be useful for developers.

== Basic oscap Usage

If you want to perform configuration or vulnerability scans of a local system
then the following must be available:

 . A tool (```oscap``` or SCAP Workbench)
 . SCAP content (XCCDF, OVAL...)

=== Installation

You can either build the OpenSCAP library and the ```oscap``` tool from
{oscap_git}[source] (for details please refer to the <<devs-compiling,compiling>> section),
or you can use an existing build for your Linux distribution. Use the
following yum command if you want to install the oscap tool on your
Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux distribution:

----------------------------
# yum install openscap-scanner
----------------------------

NOTE: If the ```openscap-scanner``` is not available install
 ```openscap-utils``` instead.

Before you can start using the ```oscap``` tool you must have some SCAP content
on your system.  You can download it from the respective web site but we
will use the SSG project in the following sections. You can build it from the
{ssg_git}[source] or you can install it using a package management system:

----------------------------
# yum install scap-security-guide
----------------------------

The SCAP content will be installed in *__/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/__*.

When the SCAP content is imported or installed on your system, ```oscap``` can
process the content by specifying the file path to the content. The ```oscap```
supports SCAP {scap_1-2}[1.2] and is backward compatible with SCAP
{scap_1-1}[1.1] and SCAP {scap_1-0}[1.0]. No special treatment is required in
order to import and process earlier versions of the SCAP content.

To display the version of oscap, supported specifications, built-in CPE
names, and supported OVAL objects, type the following command:

----------
$ oscap -V
----------

=== Displaying Information SCAP Content
One of the capabilities of ```oscap``` is to display information about the SCAP
contents within a file. Running the ```oscap info``` command allows the
examination of the internal structure of a SCAP document and displays
information such as the document type, specification version, status, the date
the document was published (Generated) and the date the document was copied to
file system (Imported). When examining an XCCDF document or a SCAP data stream,
generally, the most useful information is about profiles, checklists, and
streams. The following example demonstrates usage of the command:

 $ oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml

The following is a sample output of the command above:

----

=== Scanning with OSCAP
The main goal of the ```oscap``` tool is to perform configuration and
vulnerability scans of a local system. Oscap is able to evaluate both
XCCDF benchmarks and OVAL definitions and generate the appropriate
results. Please note that SCAP content can be provided either in a
single file (as an OVAL file or SCAP Data Stream), or as multiple
separate XML files. The following examples distinguish between these two
approaches.

==== OVAL
The SCAP document can have a form of a single OVAL file (an OVAL
Definition file). The ```oscap``` tool processes the OVAL Definition file
during evaluation of OVAL definitions. It collects system
information, evaluates it and generates an OVAL Result file. The result
of evaluation of each OVAL definition is printed to standard output
stream. The following examples describe the most common scenarios
involving an OVAL Definition file.

* To evaluate all definitions within the given OVAL Definition file, run
the following command:
----------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap oval eval --results oval-results.xml scap-oval.xml
----------------------------------------------------------
Where *scap-oval.xml* is the OVAL Definition file and *oval-results.xml*
is the OVAL Result file.

* The following is an example of evaluating one particular definition
within the given OVAL Definition file:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap oval eval --id oval:rhel:def:1000 --results oval-results.xml scap-oval.xml
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where the OVAL definition being evaluated is defined by the
*oval:rhel:def:1000* string, *scap-oval.xml* is the OVAL Definition file
and *oval-results.xml* is the OVAL Result file.

* To evaluate all definitions from the OVAL component that are part of a
particular data stream within a SCAP data stream collection, run the
following command:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap oval eval --datastream-id ds.xml --oval-id xccdf.xml --results oval-results.xml scap-ds.xml
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Where *ds.xml* is the given data stream, *xccdf.xml* is an XCCDF file
specifying the OVAL component, *oval-results.xml* is the OVAL Result
file, and *scap-ds.xml* is a file representing the SCAP data stream
collection.


When the SCAP content is represented by multiple XML files, the OVAL
Definition file can be distributed along with the XCCDF file. In such a
situation, OVAL Definitions may depend on variables that are exported
from the XCCDF file during the scan, and separate evaluation of the OVAL
definition(s) would produce misleading results. Therefore, any external
variables has to be exported to a special file that is used during the
OVAL definitions evaluation. The following commands are examples of this
scenario:

----
$ oscap xccdf export-oval-variables --profile united_states_government_configuration_baseline usgcb-rhel5desktop-xccdf.xml
----
----
$ oscap oval eval --variables usgcb-rhel5desktop-oval.xml-0.variables-0.xml --results usgcb-results-oval.xml usgcb-rhel5desktop-oval.xml
----
Where *united_states_government_configuration_baseline* represents a
profile in the XCCDF document, *usgcb-rhel5desktop-xccdf.xml* is a file
specifying the XCCDF document, *usgcb-rhel5desktop-oval.xml* is the OVAL
Definition file, *usgcb-rhel5desktop-oval.xml-0.variables-0.xml* is the
file containing exported variables from the XCCDF file, and
*usgcb-results-oval.xml* is the the OVAL Result file.

An OVAL directives file can be used to control whether results should be "thin" or "full".
This file can be loaded by OpenSCAP using *--directives <file>* option.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap oval eval --directives directives.xml --datastream-id ds.xml --oval-id xccdf.xml --results oval-results.xml scap-ds.xml
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==== XCCDF
When evaluating an XCCDF benchmark, ```oscap``` usually processes an XCCDF
file, an OVAL file and the CPE dictionary. It performs system
analysis and produces XCCDF results based on this analysis. The results
of the scan do not have to be saved in a separate file but can be
attached to the XCCDF file. The evaluation result of each XCCDF rule
within an XCCDF checklist is printed to standard output stream. The CVE
and CCE identifiers associated with the rules are printed as well. The
following is a sample output for a single XCCDF rule:

----
Title   Verify permissions on 'group' file
Rule    usgcb-rhel5desktop-rule-2.2.3.1.j
Ident   CCE-3967-7
Result  pass
----

The CPE dictionary is used to determine whether the content is
applicable on the target platform or not. Any content that is not
applicable will result in each relevant XCCDF rule being evaluated to
"notapplicable".

The following examples show the most common scenarios of XCCDF benchmark
evaluation:

* To evaluate a specific profile in an XCCDF file run this command:

----
$ oscap xccdf eval --profile Desktop --results xccdf-results.xml --cpe cpe-dictionary.xml scap-xccdf.xml
----

Where *scap-xccdf.xml* is the XCCDF document, *Desktop* is the selected
profile from the XCCDF document, *xccdf-results.xml* is a file storing
the scan results, and *cpe-dictionary.xml* is the CPE dictionary.


* To evaluate a specific XCCDF benchmark that is part of a data stream
within a SCAP data stream collection run the following command:

----
$ oscap xccdf eval --datastream-id ds.xml --xccdf-id xccdf.xml --results xccdf-results.xml scap-ds.xml
----

Where *scap-ds.xml* is a file representing the SCAP data stream
collection, *ds.xml* is the particular data stream, *xccdf.xml* is ID of
the component-ref pointing to the desired XCCDF document, and
*xccdf-results.xml* is a file containing the scan results.

NOTE: If you omit ```--datastream-id``` on the command line, the first data
stream from the collection will be used. If you omit ```--xccdf-id```, the
first component from the checklists element will be used. If you omit
both, the first data stream that has a component in the checklists
element will be used - the first component in its checklists element
will be used.


* (Alternative, not recommended) To evaluate a specific XCCDF benchmark
that is part of a data stream within a SCAP data stream collection run
the following command:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap xccdf eval --benchmark-id benchmark_id --results xccdf-results.xml scap-ds.xml
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where *scap-ds.xml* is a file representing the SCAP data stream
collection, *benchmark_id* is a string matching the "id" attribute of
xccdf:Benchmark containing in a component, and *xccdf-results.xml* is a
file containing the scan results.

=== Remediate System
OpenSCAP allows to automatically remediate systems that have been found in a
non-compliant state. For system remediation, an XCCDF file with instructions is
required. The _scap-security-guide_ package constains certain remediation
instructions.

System remediation consists of the following steps:

 . ```oscap``` performs a regular XCCDF evaluation.
 . An assessment of the results is performed by evaluating the OVAL definitions.
 Each rule that has failed is marked as a candidate for remediation.
 . ```oscap``` searches for an appropriate fix element, resolves it, prepares the
 environment, and executes the fix script.
 . Any output of the fix script is captured by ```oscap``` and stored within the
 *rule-result* element. The return value of the fix script is stored as well.
 . Whenever ```oscap``` executes a fix script, it immediatelly evaluates the OVAL
 definition again (to verify that the fix script has been applied correctly).
 During this second run, if the OVAL evaluation returns success, the result of
 the rule is *fixed*, otherwise it is an *error*.
 . Detailed results of the remediation are stored in an output XCCDF file. It
 contains two *TestResult* elements. The first *TestResult* element represents the
 scan prior to the remediation. The second *TestResult* is derived from the first
 one and contains remediation results.

There are three modes of operation of ```oscap``` with regard to remediation:
online, offline, and review.

==== Online Remediation
Online remediation executes fix elements at the time of scanning. Evaluation and
remediation are performed as a part of a single command.

To enable online remediation, use the ```--remediate``` command-line option. For
example, to execute online remediation using the _scap-security-guide_ package,
run:

----
$ oscap xccdf eval --remediate --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_rht-ccp --results scan-xccdf-results.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml
----

The output of this command consists of two sections. The first section shows the
result of the scan prior to the remediation, and the second section shows the
result of the scan after applying the remediation. The second part can contain
only *fixed* and *error* results. The *fixed* result indicates that the scan performed
after the remediation passed. The *error* result indicates that even after
applying the remediation, the evaluation still does not pass.

==== Offline Remediation
Offline remediation allows you to postpone fix execution. In first step, the
system is only evaluated, and the results are stored in a *TestResult* element in
an XCCDF file.

In the second step, ```oscap``` executes the fix scripts and verifies the result. It
is safe to store the results into the input file, no data will be lost. During
offline remediation, a new *TestResult* element is created that is based
on the input one and inherits all the data. The newly created *TestResult*
differs only in the *rule-result* elements that have failed. For those,
remediation is executed.

To perform offline remediation using the _scap-security-guide_ package, run:

----
$ oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_rht-ccp --results scan-xccdf-results.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml
----
----
$ oscap xccdf remediate --results scan-xccdf-results.xml scan-xccdf-results.xml
----

==== Remediation Review
The review mode allows users to store remediation instructions to a file for
further review. The remediation content is not executed during this operation.
To generate remediation instructions in the form of a shell script, run:

 $ oscap xccdf generate fix --template urn:xccdf:fix:script:sh --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_rht-ccp --output my-remediation-script.sh /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml


=== Check Engines
Most XCCDF content uses the OVAL check engine. This is when OVAL
Definitions are being evaluated in order to assess a system. Complete
information of an evaluation is recorded in OVAL Results files, as
defined by the OVAL specification. By examining these files it's
possible check what definitions were used for the evaluation and why the
results are as they are. Please note these files are not generated
unless *--oval-results* is used.

Some content may use alternative check engines, for example the
{sce_web}[SCE] check engine.

Results of rules with a check that requires a check engine not supported
by OpenSCAP will be reported as *notchecked*. Check contents are not
read or interpreted in any way unless the check system is known and
supported. Following is an evaluation output of an XCCDF with unknown
check system:

--------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap xccdf eval sds-datastream.xml

Title   Check group file contents
Rule    xccdf_org.example_rule_system_authcontent-group
Result  notchecked

Title   Check password file contents
Rule    xccdf_org.example_rule_system_authcontent-passwd
Result  notchecked

Title   Check shadow file contents
Rule    xccdf_org.example_rule_system_authcontent-shadow
Result  notchecked

...
--------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: The *notchecked* result is also reported for rules that have no
check implemented. *notchecked* means that there was no check in that
particular rule that could be evaluated.


==== CVE, CCE and other identifiers
Each XCCDF Rule can have xccdf:ident elements inside. These elements
allow the content creator to reference various external identifiers like
CVE, CCE and others.

When scanning, oscap output identifiers of scanned rules regardless of
their results. For example:

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title   Ensure Repodata Signature Checking is Not Disabled For Any Repos
Rule    rule-2.1.2.3.6.a
Result  pass

Title   Verify user who owns 'shadow' file
Rule    rule-2.2.3.1.a
Ident   CCE-3918-0
Result  pass

Title   Verify group who owns 'shadow' file
Rule    rule-2.2.3.1.b
Ident   CCE-3988-3
Result  pass
------------------------------------------------------------------------

All identifiers (if any) are printed to stdout for each rule. Since
standard output doesn't allow for compact identifier metadata to be
displayed, only the identifiers themselves are displayed there.

Identifiers are also part of the HTML report output. If the identifier
is a CVE you can click it to display its metadata from the official NVD
database (requires internet connection). OpenSCAP doesn't provide
metadata for other types of identifiers.

Another place where these identifiers can be found are machine-readable Result Datastream files.
This file can be generated during the scan by adding *--results-arf* option.

 $ oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_common --fetch-remote-resources --results-arf results.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel6-ds.xml 

Result data stream file **results.xml** contains these identifiers in <rule-result>
elements.


==== Bundled CCE data
OpenSCAP does not provide any static or product bundled CCE data. Thus
it has no way of displaying the last generated, updated and officially
published dates of static or product bundled CCE data because the dates
are not defined.




== Advanced oscap usage

=== Validating SCAP Content
Before you start using a security policy on your systems, you should first
verify the policy in order to avoid any possible syntax or semantic errors in
the policy. The ```oscap``` tool can be used to validate the security content
against standard SCAP XML schemas. The validation results are printed to the
standard error stream (stderr). The general syntax of such a validation command
is the following:

 $ scap module validate [module_options_and_arguments] file

where file is the full path to the file being validated. As a ```module``` you
can use:

  * xccdf,
  * oval,
  * cpe or
  * cve.

The only exception is the data stream module (ds), which uses the sds-validate
operation instead of validate. So for example, it would be like:

 $ oscap ds sds-validate scap-ds.xml

NOTE: Note that all SCAP components within the given data stream are validated
automatically and none of the components is specified separately.

You can also enable extra Schematron-based validation if you validate OVAL
specification. This validation method is slower but it provides deeper analysis.
Run the following command to validate an OVAL document using Schematron:

 $ oscap oval validate --schematron oval-file.xml

The results of validation are printed to standard error stream (stderr).

NOTE: Please note that for the rest of ```oscap``` functionality, unless you specify
--skip-valid, validation will automatically occur before files are used.
Therefore, you do not need to explicitly validate a datastream before
use.


=== SCAP Content Signing and Signature Verification
The ```oscap``` itself does not do signature verification. It skips over the
respective elements. This is due to the fact that there are way too many options
when it comes to keystores and crypto choices. Instead we recommend users to use
{xmlsec}[xmlsec1] to verify their SCAP content.  Safely evaluating signed
content (with signature verification) involves the following steps:

1) Install xmlsec1 and at least one of its crypto engines
-------------------------------------
# yum install xmlsec1 xmlsec1-openssl
-------------------------------------

2) Run ```xmlsec1 --verify``` on the content:

This simple example will only show 2 specific cases of verifying the
signature, the steps may vary depending on which technique was used to
sign the datastream.

Assuming the datastream was signed with a private key and we have the
respective public key to verify it with:

------------------------------------------------------
$ xmlsec1 --verify --pubkey-pem pub.key datastream.xml
------------------------------------------------------

Assuming the datastream was signed with a certificate and we have the
respective public part of the certificate to verify it with:

---------------------------------------------------------------
$ xmlsec1 --verify --pubkey-cert-pem pubcert.key datastream.xml
---------------------------------------------------------------

There are countless other options, for more details see: ```xmlsec1
--help-verify```

Successful output should look similar to this:

-----------------------------------------------------
$ xmlsec1 verify --pubkey-pem key.pub datastream.xml
OK
SignedInfo References (ok/all): 1/1
Manifests References (ok/all): 0/0
-----------------------------------------------------

And the exit code must be 0 before proceeding.

3) If the previous steps resulted in successful verification, proceed
by evaluating the datastream:

---------------------------------
$ oscap xccdf eval datastream.xml
---------------------------------

NOTE: If you want to experiment with various crypto engines of xmlsec1, see
 ```xmlsec1-config --help```


=== Generating Reports and Guides
Another useful features of ```oscap``` is the ability to generate SCAP content in a
human-readable format. It allows you to transform an XML file
into HTML or plain-text format. This feature is used to generate security
guides and checklists, which serve as a source of information, as well as
guidance for secure system configuration. The results of system scans can also
be transformed to well-readable result reports. The general command syntax is
the following:

 $ oscap module generate sub-module [specific_module/sub-module_options_and_arguments] file

where module is either ```xccdf``` or ```oval```, ```sub-module``` is a type of
the generated document, and file represents an XCCDF or OVAL file. A sub-module
can be either ```report```, ```guide```, ```custom``` or ```fix```. Please see
 ```man oscap``` for more details.


=== Content Transformation
The oscap tool is also capable of using the {xslt}[XSLT] (Extensible Stylesheet
Language Transformations) language, which allows transformation of a SCAP
content XML file into another XML, HTML, plain text or {xsl}[XSL] document.
This feature is very useful when you need the SCAP document in a
human-readable form. The following commands represent the most common
cases:

* Creating a guide (see an
http://mpreisle.fedorapeople.org/openscap/guide.html[example]):
--------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap xccdf generate guide scap-xccdf.xml > guide.html
--------------------------------------------------------

* Creating a guide with profile checklist (see an
http://mpreisle.fedorapeople.org/openscap/guide-checklist.html[example]):
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap xccdf generate guide --profile Desktop scap-xccdf.xml > guide-checklist.html
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Generating the XCCDF scan report (see an
http://mpreisle.fedorapeople.org/openscap/report-xccdf.html[example]):
-------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap xccdf generate report xccdf-results.xml > report-xccdf.html
-------------------------------------------------------------------

* Generating the OVAL scan report (see an
http://mpreisle.fedorapeople.org/openscap/report-oval.html[example]):
----------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap oval generate report oval-results.xml > report-oval.html
----------------------------------------------------------------

* Generating the XCCDF report with additional information from failed
OVAL tests (see an
http://mpreisle.fedorapeople.org/openscap/report-xccdf-oval.html[example]):
----
$ oscap xccdf generate report --oval-template oval-results.xml xccdf-results.xml > report-xccdf-oval.html
----


=== CPE applicability
XCCDF rules in the content may target only specific platforms and hold
no meaning on other platforms. Such an XCCDF rule contains an
*<xccdf:platform>* element in its body. This element references a CPE
name or CPE2 platform (defined using **cpe2:platform-specification**)
that could be defined in a CPE dictionary file or a CPE language file
or it can also be embedded directly in the XCCDF document.

An XCCDF rule can contain multiple *<xccdf:platform>* elements. It is
deemed applicable if at least one of the listed platforms is applicable.
If an XCCDF rule contains no *<xccdf:platform>* elements it is considered
always applicable.

If the CPE name or CPE2 platform is defined in an external file, use the
 ```--cpe``` option and ```oscap``` auto-detects format of the file. The following
command is an example of the XCCDF content evaluation using CPE name
from an external file:

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap xccdf eval --results xccdf-results.xml --cpe external-cpe-file.xml xccdf-file.xml
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Where *xccdf-file.xml* is the XCCDF document, *xccdf-results.xml* is a file
containing the scan results, and *external-cpe-file.xml* is the CPE
dictionary or a language file.

If you are evaluating a source data stream, ```oscap``` automatically
registers all CPEs contained within the data stream. No extra steps have
to be taken. You can also register an additional external CPE file, as
shown by the command below:

----
$ oscap xccdf eval --datastream-id ds.xml --xccdf-id xccdf.xml --results xccdf-results.xml --cpe additional-external-cpe.xml scap-ds.xml
----

Where *scap-ds.xml* is a file representing the SCAP data stream
collection, *ds.xml* is the particular data stream, *xccdf.xml* is the
XCCDF document, *xccdf-results.xml* is a file containing the scan
results, and *additional-external-cpe.xml* is the additional CPE
dictionary or language file.

The ```oscap``` tool will use an OVAL file attached to the CPE dictionary to
determine applicability of any CPE name in the dictionary.

Apart from the instructions above, no extra steps have to be taken for
content using *cpe:fact-ref* or **cpe2:fact-ref**. See the following
sections for details on resolving.

==== xccdf:platform applicability resolution

When a CPE name or language model platform is referenced via
*<xccdf:platform>* elements, resolution happens in the following order:

 . Look into embedded CPE2 language model if name is found and applicable deem
 it applicable
 . If not found or not applicable, look into external CPE2 language models
 (order of registration)
 . If not found or not applicable, look into embedded CPE dictionary
 . If not found or not applicable, look into external CPE dictionaries (order of
 registration)

If the CPE name is not found in any of the sources, it is deemed not
applicable. If it is found in any of the sources but not applicable, we
look for it elsewhere.

==== cpe:fact-ref and cpe2:fact-ref resolution

CPE name referenced from within fact-ref is resolved in the following
order:

.  Look into embedded CPE dictionary, if name is found and applicable
deem it applicable
.  If not found or not applicable, look into external CPE dictionaries
(order of registration)

==== Built-in CPE Naming Dictionary

Apart from the external CPE Dictionaries, ```oscap``` comes with an inbuilt
CPE Dictionary. The built-in CPE Dictionary contains only a few products
(sub-set of http://nvd.nist.gov/cpe.cfm[Official CPE Dictionary]) and it
is used as a fall-back option when there is no other CPE source found.

The list of inbuilt CPE names can be found in the output of

-----------------
$ oscap --version
-----------------

You can file a request to include any additional product in the built-in
dictionary via https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/open-scap-list[open-scap
mailing list] or
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=Fedora[bugzilla].


=== Notes on the Concept of Multiple OVAL Values
This section describes advanced concepts of OVAL Variables and their
implementation in ```oscap```. The SCAP specification allows for an OVAL
variable to have multiple values during a single assessment run. There
are two variable modes which can be combined:

* Multival -- A variable is assigned with multiple values at the same
time. As an example, consider a variable which refers to preferred
permission of a given file, that may take multiple values like: '600',
'400'. The evaluation tries to match each (or all) and then outputs a
single OVAL Definition result.
* Multiset -- A variable is assigned with a different value (or
multival) for different evaluations. This is known as a
*variable_instance*. As an example consider an OVAL definition which
checks that a package given by a variable is not installed. For the first
evaluation of the definition, the variable can be assigned with
'telnet-server' value, for second time the variable can be assigned with
'tftp-server' value. Therefore both evaluations may output different
results. Thus, the OVAL Results file may contain multiple results for
the same definition, these are distinguished by *variable_instance*
attribute.

These two concepts are a source of confusion for both the content
authors and the result consumers. On one hand, the first concept is well
supported by the standard and the OVAL Variable file format. It allows
multiple *<value>* elements for each *<variable>* element. On the other
hand, the second concept is not supported by an OVAL Variable schema
which prevents fully automated evaluation of the multisets (unless you
use XCCDF to bridge that gap).

TIP: ```oscap``` supports both variable modes as described below.

==== Sources of Variable Values
First we need to understand how a single value can be bound to a
variable in the OVAL checking engine. There are three ways to do this:

1)  OVAL Variables File -- The values of external variables can be
defined in an external file. Such a file is called an OVAL Variable File
and can be recognized by using the following command: `oscap info
file.xml`. The OVAL Variables file can be passed to the evaluation by
 ```--variables``` argument such as:
----
$ oscap oval eval --variables usgcb-rhel5desktop-oval.xml-0.variables-0.xml --results usgcb-results-oval.xml usgcb-rhel5desktop-oval.xml
----

2)  XCCDF Bindings -- The values of external variables can be given from
an XCCDF file. In the XCCDF file within each *<xccdf:check>* element,
there might be *<xccdf:check-export>* elements. These elements allow
transition of *<xccdf:value>* elements to *<oval:variables>* elements. The
following command allows users to export variable bindings from XCCDF to
an OVAL Variables file:
----
$ oscap xccdf export-oval-variables --profile united_states_government_configuration_baseline usgcb-rhel5desktop-xccdf.xml
----

3)  Values within an OVAL Definition File -- Variables' values defined
directly in the OVAL definitions file *<constant_variable>* and
*<local_variable>* elements.

==== Evaluation of Multiple OVAL Values
With ```oscap```, there are two possible ways how two or more values can be
specified for a variable used by one OVAL definition. The approach you choose
depends on what mode you want to use, multival or multiset.

The ```oscap``` handles multiple OVAL values seemlessly; such that user doesn't
need to do anything differently than what she (or he) does for a normal scan.
The command below demonstrates evaluation of DataStream, which may include
multiset, multival, or both concepts combined, or none of them.
----
$ oscap xccdf eval --profile my_baseline --results-arf scap-arf.xml --cpe additional-external-cpe.xml scap-ds.xml
----

==== Multival
Multival can pass multiple values to a single OVAL definition
evaluation. This can be accomplished by all three ways as described in
previous section.

1)  OVAL Variables file -- This option is straight forward. The file
format (XSD schema) allows for multiple *<value>* elements within each
*<variable>* element.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <variable id="oval:com.example.www:var:1" datatype="string" comment="Unknown">
    <value>600</value>
    <value>400</value>
  </variable>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)  XCCDF Bindings -- Use multiple *<xccdf:check-export>* referring to the
very same OVAL variable binding with multiple different XCCDF values.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5">
    <check-export value-id="xccdf_com.example.www_value_1" export-name="oval:com.example.www:var:1"/>
    <check-export value-id="xccdf_com.example.www_value_2" export-name="oval:com.example.www:var:1"/>
    <check-content-ref href="my-test-oval.xml" name="oval:com.example.www:def:1"/>
  </check>
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3)  Values within OVAL Definitions file -- This is similar to using a
Variables file, there are multiple *<value>* elements allowed within
*<constant_variable>* or *<local_variable>* elements.

==== Multiset
Multiset allows for the very same OVAL definition to be evaluated
multiple times using different values assigned to the variables for each
evaluation. In OpenSCAP, this is only possible by option (2) XCCDF
Bindings. The following XCCDF snippet evaluates twice the very same OVAL
Definition, each time it binds a different value to the OVAL variable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <Rule id="xccdf_moc.elpmaxe.www_rule_1" selected="true">
    <check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5">
      <check-export value-id="xccdf_moc.elpmaxe.www_value_1" export-name="oval:com.example.www:var:1"/>
      <check-content-ref href="my-test-oval.xml" name="oval:com.example.www:def:1"/>
    </check>
  </Rule>
  <Rule id="xccdf_moc.elpmaxe.www_rule_2" selected="true">
    <check system="http://oval.mitre.org/XMLSchema/oval-definitions-5">
      <check-export value-id="xccdf_moc.elpmaxe.www_value_2" export-name="oval:com.example.www:var:1"/>
      <check-content-ref href="my-test-oval.xml" name="oval:com.example.www:def:1"/>
    </check>
  </Rule>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After the evaluation, the OVAL results file will contain multiple
result-definitions and multiple result-tests and multiple
collected-objects. The elements of the same id will be differentiated by
the value of the *variable_instance* attribute. Each of the
definitions/tests/object might have a different result of evaluation.
The following snippet of OVAL results file illustrates output of a
multiset evaluation.

----
    <tests>
      <test test_id="oval:com.example.www:tst:1" version="1" check="at least one" result="true" variable_instance="1">
        <tested_item item_id="1117551" result="true"/>
        <tested_variable variable_id="oval:com.example.www:var:1">600</tested_variable>
      </test>
      <test test_id="oval:com.example.www:tst:1" version="1" check="at least one" result="false" variable_instance="2">
        <tested_item item_id="1117551" result="false"/>
        <tested_variable variable_id="oval:com.example.www:var:1">400</tested_variable>
      </test>
    </tests>

== Practical Examples
This section demonstrates practical usage of certain security content provided
for Red Hat products.

These practical examples show usage of industry standard checklists that
were validated by NIST.

=== Auditing System Settings with SCAP Security Guide
The SSG project contains guidance for settings of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

1) Install the SSG

 $ sudo yum install -y scap-security-guide

2) To inspect the security content use the ```oscap info``` module:

 $ oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/rhel7/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml

The output of this command contains available configuration profiles. To audit
your system settings choose the
 ```xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_rht-ccp``` profile and run the
evaluation command . For example, the The following command is used to assess
the given system against a draft SCAP profile for Red Hat Certified Cloud
Providers:

 $ oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_rht-ccp
--results ssg-rhel7-xccdf-result.xml --report ssg-rhel7-report.html
/usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/rhel7/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml


=== Auditing Security Vulnerabilities of Red Hat Products
The Red Hat Security Response Team provides OVAL definitions for all
vulnerabilities (identified by CVE name) that affect Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. This enable users to perform a vulnerability scan
and diagnose whether system is vulnerable or not. The data is provided in
two formats -- OVAL file, OVAL + XCCDF and a Source DataStream.

==== OVAL + XCCDF

1)  Download the content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ wget http://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/com.redhat.rhsa-all.xccdf.xml
$ wget http://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-all.xml
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)  Run the scan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap xccdf eval --results results.xml --report report.html com.redhat.rhsa-all.xccdf.xml
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the sample output. It reports that Red Hat Security
Advisory (RHSA-2013:0911) was issued but update was not applied so a
system is affected by multiple CVEs (CVE-2013-1935, CVE-2013-1943,
CVE-2013-2017)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Title   RHSA-2013:0911: kernel security, bug fix, and enhancement update (Important)
Rule    oval-com.redhat.rhsa-def-20130911
Ident   CVE-2013-1935
Ident   CVE-2013-1943
Ident   CVE-2013-2017
Result  fail
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human readable report *report.html* is generated by side with "machine"
readable report **results.xml**. Both files hold information about
vulnerability status of scanned system. They map RHSA to CVEs and report
what security advisories are not applied. CVE identifiers are linked
with National Vulnerability Databases where additional information like:
CVE description, CVSS score, CVSS vector, etc. are stored.

==== OVAL

1)  Download the content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ wget http://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/com.redhat.rhsa-all.xml
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)  Run the scan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap oval eval --results results.xml --report report.html com.redhat.rhsa-all.xml
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the sample output. It reports that Red Hat Security
Advisory (RHSA-2013:0911) was issued but update was not applied.
Notice that the standard output is different from the XCCDF + OVAL output.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Definition oval:com.redhat.rhsa:def:20130911: true
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human readable report *report.html* is generated by side with "machine"
readable report **results.xml**. Both files hold information about
vulnerability status of scanned system. They map RHSA to CVEs and report
what security advisories are not applied. CVE identifiers are linked
with National Vulnerability Databases where additional information like:
CVE description, CVSS score, CVSS vector, etc. are stored.


==== Source DataStream
The Source DataStream use-case is very similar to OVAL+XCCDF. The only
difference is that you don't have to download two separate files.

1)  Download the content
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ wget http://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/ds/com.redhat.rhsa-all.ds.xml
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)  Run the scan
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ oscap xccdf eval --results results.xml --report report.html com.redhat.rhsa-all.ds.xml
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


==== More Specialized Files

The files we used above cover multiple Red Hat products. If you only want to
scan one product - for example a specific version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux -
we advise to download a smaller specialized file covering just that one version.
Using a smaller file will waste less bandwidth and make the evaluation quicker.

For example for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 the plain OVAL file is located at:

----
$ wget https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_7.xml
----

You can get a list of all the plain OVAL files by visiting
https://www.redhat.com/security/data/oval/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_7.xml

The list of available datastream files is available at
https://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/ds/


==== Disclaimer
NOTE: Note that these OVAL definitions are designed to only cover software and
updates released by Red Hat. You need to provide additional definitions in order
to detect the patch status of third-party software.

To find out more information about this project, see
http://www.redhat.com/security/data/metrics/.


=== How to Evaluate PCI-DSS on RHEL7
This section describes how to evaluate the Payment Card Industry Data Security
Standard (PCI-DSS) on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.

1) Install SSG which provides the PCI-DSS SCAP content

 $ sudo yum install -y scap-security-guide

2) Verify that the PCI-DSS profile is present

 $ oscap info /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml

3) Evaluate the PCI-DSS content

 $ oscap xccdf eval --results results.xml --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_pci-dss /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel7-ds.xml

4) Generate report readable in a web browser.

 $ oscap xccdf generate report --output report.html results.xml

=== How to Evaluate DISA STIG
This section describes how to evaluate the Defense Information Systems Agency
(DISA) Security Technical Implementation Guide (STIG) on Red Hat Eneterprise
Linux 6.

1) Download the DISA STIG content.
----
$ wget http://iasecontent.disa.mil/stigs/zip/July2015/U_RedHat_6_V1R8_STIG_SCAP_1-1_Benchmark.zip
----

2) Unpack the content.
---------------------------------------------------
$ unzip U_RedHat_6_V1R8_STIG.zip
---------------------------------------------------

3)  Fix the content using a sed substitution.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ sed -i 's/<Group\ \(.*\)/<Group\ selected="false"\ \1/g' U_RedHat_6_V1R8_STIG_SCAP_1-1_Benchmark-xccdf.xml
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

NOTE: Why is the substitution needed? According to the {xccdf_1-2}[XCCDF
specification 1.2] the ```selected``` attribute for *Rule* or *Group* is *true* by default.
It means that if you create a new profile even with only one rule selected, all
rules within the benchmark will be evaluated because they are set to true by default. The
substitution will set all Groups as unselected by default which means all
descendants will also be unselected by default.

4) Display a list of available profiles.

 $ oscap info U_RedHat_6_V1R8_STIG_SCAP_1-1_Benchmark-xccdf.xml

5)  Evaluate your favorite profile, for example *MAC-1_Public*, and write
XCCDF results into the results.xml file.
----
$ oscap xccdf eval --profile MAC-1_Public --results results.xml --cpe U_RedHat_6_V1R8_STIG_SCAP_1-1_Benchmark-cpe-dictionary.xml U_RedHat_6_V1R8_STIG_SCAP_1-1_Benchmark-xccdf.xml
----

6) Generate a scan report that is readable in a web browser.
-----
$ oscap xccdf generate report --output report.html results.xml
-----

If you are interested in DISA STIG content for RHEL5 or RHEL7 please visit
{nvd}[National Vulnerability Database] and look for *Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6*
or *Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7* as a target product.

=== How to Evaluate United States Government Configuration Baseline (USGCB)
NOTE: NIST offers no official USGCB for RHEL6 as of September 2014 but you can
acquire the content from the {ssg_git}[SSG] project.

The USGCB content for represents Tier IV Checklist for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 (as defined by NIST Special Publication 800-70).

WARNING: Proper evaluation of the USGCB document requires OpenSCAP version 0.9.1
or later.

After ensuring that version of OpenSCAP on your system is
sufficient, perform the following tasks:

1)  Download the USGCB content.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ wget http://usgcb.nist.gov/usgcb/content/scap/USGCB-rhel5desktop-1.2.5.0.zip
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2)  Unpack the USGCB content.
--------------------------------------
$ unzip USGCB-rhel5desktop-1.2.5.0.zip
--------------------------------------

3)  Run evaluation of the USGCB content.
----
$ oscap xccdf eval --profile united_states_government_configuration_baseline --cpe usgcb-rhel5desktop-cpe-dictionary.xml --oval-results --fetch-remote-resources --results results.xml usgcb-rhel5desktop-xccdf.xml
----

4) Generate a scan report that is readable in a web browser.
-----
$ oscap xccdf generate report --output report.html results.xml
-----

Additional reports can be generated from detailed OVAL result files.
Scanner outputs OVAL results files in the current directory, for each
OVAL file on input there is one output. In case of USGCB, there is
one OVAL file distributed along the XCCDF, another one which is
downloaded from Red Hat Repository. The latter contains CVE information
for each evaluated definition.

----
$ oscap oval generate report --output oval-report-1.html usgcb-rhel5desktop-oval.xml.result.xml
$ oscap oval generate report --output oval-report-2.html http%3A%2F%2Fwww.redhat.com%2Fsecurity%2Fdata%2Foval%2Fcom.redhat.rhsa-all.xml.result.xml
----

If you're interested in runing evaluation of the USGCB on a remote machine using
a GUI please see:
https://open-scap.org/resources/documentation/evaluate-remote-machine-for-usgcb-compliance-with-scap-workbench/[Evaluate
Remote Machine for USGCB Compliance with SCAP Workbench] tutorial.


=== How to Evaluate Third-Party Guidances
The SCAP content repository hosted at {nvd}[National Vulnerability Database]
(NVD) can be searched for publicly available guidances for a given
product. For example, as per 2013/05/11 there are
http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/ncp/repository?tier=3&product=Red+Hat+Enterprise+Linux+5[two]
Tier III checklists for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5. Analogously, the
MITRE Corp. hosts http://oval.mitre.org/rep-data/[repository] of OVAL
content for various platforms, sorted by versions and classes.

Likewise the USGCB, any downloaded guidance can be evaluated by
OpenSCAP.

* Examplary evaluation of DoD Consensus Security Configuration Checklist
for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 (2.0)
----
$ wget http://nvd.nist.gov/ncp/DoD-RHEL5-desktop.zip
$ unzip DoD-RHEL5-desktop.zip
$ oscap xccdf eval --profile DOD_baseline_1.0.0.1 --cpe dcb-rhel5_cpe-dictionary.xml --results result.xml --oval-results dcb-rhel5_xccdf.xml
----

* Examplary evaluation of Red Hat 5 STIG Benchmark (Version 1, Release 12)
----
$ wget http://iasecontent.disa.mil/stigs/zip/July2015/U_RedHat_5_V1R12_STIG_SCAP_1-1_Benchmark.zip
$ unzip U_RedHat_5_V1R12_STIG_SCAP_1-1_Benchmark.zip
$ oscap xccdf eval --profile MAC-2_Public --cpe
U_RedHat_5_V1R12_STIG_SCAP_1-1_Benchmark-cpe-dictionary.xml --results result.xml
--oval-results U_RedHat_5_V1R12_STIG_SCAP_1-1_Benchmark-xccdf.xml
----

Furthermore, any individual file from the archive can be inspected using
the `oscap info` command line option. The oscap program does not have
the concept of importing SCAP files, therefore it can process any SCAP
files available on the filesystem. That is possible because the SCAP
standard files are native file formats of the OpenSCAP.



=== How to evaluate guidances for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
Guidances for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 can be acquired from
{ssg_git}[SCAP Security Guide
project] (SSG). SSG holds currently the most evolved and elaborate SCAP
policy for Linux systems. The project provides practical security
hardening advice for Red Hat products and also links it to compliance
requirements in order to ease deployment activities, such as
certification and accreditation.

The project started in 2011 as open collaboration of U.S. Government
bodies to develop next generation of United States Government Baseline
(USGCB) available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. There are multiple
parties contributing to the project from the public sector and private
sector.

The SSG project contains baselines for both desktops and servers. See
https://github.com/OpenSCAP/scap-security-guide



=== How to check that patches are up-to-date on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6
This section describes how to check that software patches are up-to-date using
external OVAL content.

1) Install the SSG

 $ sudo yum install -y scap-security-guide

2) Evaluate common profile

 $ oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_common --fetch-remote-resources --results-arf results.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel6-ds.xml

This command evaluates common profile for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6. Part of
the profile is a rule to check that patches are up-to-date. To evaluate the rule
correctly, oscap tool needs to download an up-to-date OVAL file from Red Hat servers. This can be
allowed using *--fetch-remote-resources* option. Result of this scan will be saved
in **results.xml** using ARF format.


=== How to tailor Source data stream
This section describes tailoring of content using Tailoring file. This allows
you to change behavior of content without its direct modification.

1) Obtain tailoring file

Tailoring file can be easily generated using {workbench_url}[SCAP Workbench].

2) List profiles of tailoring file

 $ oscap info
----
Document type: XCCDF Tailoring
Imported: 2016-08-31T11:08:16
Benchmark Hint: /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel6-ds.xml
Profiles:
	xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_C2S_customized
----

3) Evaluate

 $ oscap xccdf eval --profile xccdf_org.ssgproject.content_profile_C2S_customized --tailoring-file ssg-rhel6-ds-tailoring.xml --results results.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel6-ds.xml

The command above evaluates tailored data stream by **ssg-rhel6-ds-tailoring.xml** tailoring file.
XCCDF results can be found in **results.xml** file.

Instead of external tailoring file, you can also use tailoring component integrated to data stream.

 $ oscap info simple-ds.xml

----

----

To choose tailoring component "scap_org.open-scap_cref_simple-tailoring.xml", the command below can be used.

 $ oscap xccdf eval --tailoring-id scap_org.open-scap_cref_simple-tailoring.xml --profile xccdf_org.open-scap_profile_default --results results.xml simple-ds.xml

The command above evaluates content using tailoring component *scap_org.open-scap_cref_simple-tailoring.xml* from source data stream.
Scan results are stored in *results.xml* file.


=== Evaluation of content
Specified XCCDF or data stream content can contain zero or more profiles.

Scan can be evaluated without specific profile, otherwise profile can be selected using
*--profile* option.

 $ oscap xccdf eval --results results.xml /usr/share/xml/scap/ssg/content/ssg-rhel6-ds.xml

The command above evaluates rules without specific profile. XCCDF results are stored in *results.xml* file.



[[devs]]
== Developer's operations
This part of documentation is meant to serve mainly to developers who want to
contribute to the ```oscap```, help to fix bugs, or take an advantage of
the OpenSCAP library and create own projects on top of it.

[[devs-compiling]]
=== Compiling
If you want to build the ```libopenscap``` library and the ```oscap``` tool from
the {oscap_git}[source code] then follow these instructions:

1) Get the lastest source code

 $ git clone https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap.git

2) Run the follwoing script.

 $ ./autogen.sh

NOTE: The *autoconf*, *automake*, and *libtool* tools are required to be
installed on your system. If you use a release taball, you can skip this step.

3) Run the following commands to build the library.

 $ ./configure
 $ make

Build dependencies may vary in dependency on enabled f element in its body. This
element references a CPE name or CPE2 platform (defined using
cpe2:platform-specification) that could be defined in a CPE dictionary file or a
CPE language file; or it can also be embedded directly in the XCCDF document.

An XCCDF rule can contain multiple *<xccdf:platform>* elements. It is deemed
applicable if at least one of the listed platforms is applicable. If an XCCDF
rule contains no *<xccdf:platform>* elements it is considered always applicable.

If the CPE name or CPE2 platform is defined in an external file, use the
 ```--cpe```
option; oscap auto-detects format of the file. The following command is an
example of the XCCDF content evaluation using CPE name from an external file:

eatures (by the configure command). By default, you need the following packages
installed on your system:


* swig
* libxml2-devel
* rpm-devel
* libgcrypt-devel
* pcre-devel
* python-devel
* perl-devel
* libcurl-devel
* libxslt-devel
* libtool
* perl-XML-XPath

. Run library self-checks by executing the following command: # make check

. Run the installation procedure by executing the following command: # make install

If you want to create a package for Fedora or Red Hat Enterprise Linux
distribution, you will need the respective spec files. These spec files are
available under the following directories:

* dist/fedora
* dist/rhel5
* dist/rhel6

=== Debugging
Developers and users who intend to help find and fix possible bugs in OpenSCAP
should follow these instructions on how to enable debugging in OpenSCAP:

==== Debug mode
The first and an obvious step is to re-compile library so debug mode is
enabled.

------------------------------------
$ ./configure --enable-debug && make
------------------------------------

Debug mode provides:

* debug symbols on and optimization off - you can use ```gdb```,
* logs - ```oscap``` tool will generate *oscap_debug.log.\{pid}* log files for
every process that was run.
* http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/manual/html_node/Assert-Function.html[assertions]
are evaluated.

==== Testing library
Next important step is to ```preload libopenscap_testing.so``` before you run
 ```oscap``` tool. The testing library allows you to specify custom path to
probes via *OVAL_PROBE_DIR* environment variable. The easiest way how to
achieve that without need to install libopenscap, is to use shell
script called *run* in the OpenSCAP directory.

-------------------------------------------------
$ ./run utils/.libs/oscap xccdf eval ... whatever
-------------------------------------------------

The *run* script is generated at configure time and it sets:

* **LD_PRELOAD* and *LD_LIBRARY_PATH* - preload ```libopenscap_testing.so```
* *OVAL_PROBE_DIR* - path to probes
* *OSCAP_SCHEMA_PATH* - path to XCCDF, OVAL, CPE, ... schemas. (required
for valudation)
* *OSCAP_XSLT_PATH*- path to XSLT transformations. (required if you want
to generate html documents from xml)

==== Example

 $ ./run gdb --args utils/.libs/oscap xccdf eval --profile hard --results xccdf-results.xml --oval-results my-favourite-xccdf-checklist.xml


The ```--oval-results``` option force ```oscap``` tool to generate OVAL Result file
for each OVAL session used for evaluation. It's also very useful for
debugging!

==== Debugging probes
It's also possible to debug a probe itself. You need to raise timeout
value for thread join in ```src/OVAL/probes/probe/main.c:228``` and rebuild
sources.

----------------------------
-       j_tm.tv_sec += 3;
+       j_tm.tv_sec += 3000;
----------------------------

Then you can run gdb with probe binary:
--------------------------------------------------------
$ ./run gdb src/OVAL/probes/.libs/probe_rpmverifypackage
--------------------------------------------------------

An input for the probe can be found in ```oscap_debug.log``` created by
previous ```oscap``` tool run, e.g.:

----
 ("seap.msg" ":id" 0 (("rpmverifypackage_object" ":id" "oval:org.mitre.oval.test:obj:1386" ":oval_version" 84541440 ) (("name" ":operation" 5 ":var_check" 1 ) "plymouth" ) (("behaviors" ":nodeps" "false" ":nodigest" "false" ":noscripts" "true" ":nosignature" "false" ) ) ) )
----

==== Environment variables
There are few more environment variables that control ```oscap``` tool
behaviour.

* *OSCAP_FULL_VALIDATION=1* - validate all exported documents (slower)
* *SEXP_VALIDATE_DISABLE=1* - do not validate SEXP expressions (faster)
* *OSCAP_DEBUG_FILE="foo"* - name for debug files
* *OSCAP_DEBUG_LEVEL=2* - set verbosity in debug logs
** ```1``` for Errors
** ```2``` for Errors & Warnings
** ```3``` for Errors & Warnings & Info messages



=== Scanning with Script Check Engine (SCE)
The Script Check Engine (SCE) is an alternative check engine for XCCDF checklist
evaluation.  SCE allows you to call shell scripts out of the XCCDF document.
This approach might be suitable for various use cases, mostly when OVAL checks
are not required. More information about SCE usage is available on this page:
{sce_web}[Using SCE].

WARNING: SCE is not part of any SCAP specification.


=== Building OpenSCAP on Windows
The OpenSCAP library is developed mainly on Linux platform but it can be built
also on Windows platforms. Follow these instructions to build
OpenSCAP on Windows using Cygwin:

1.  The easiest way to compile OpenSCAP on Windows is in
http://www.cygwin.com/[cygwin]. First install basic set of packages from
*cygwin* distribution plus:
* *autoconf automake libtool make gcc*
* *pcre-devel libxml2-devel libcurl-devel libgrcypt-devel*
* *swig perl python*
2.  Checkout the master branch of OpenSCAP:

 $ git clone -b master https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap.git

3.  Run autotools machinery by

 $ ./autogen.sh

4. Unfortunately the probes support is platform dependent and windows code
was not implemented yet so it's necessary to disable compilation of probes by

 $ configure --disable-probes

5. Build the library

 $ make build

6.  You might want to run the library self-check by

 $ make check

7.  Install the library

 $ make install

8.  The final DLL is called ```cygopenscap-0.dll``` and you can link you app
to it.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example: gcc myapp.c -I/path/to/headers -L/path/to/dynamic/library -lcygopenscap-0
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to run your app, make sure ```cygopenscap-0.dll``` is either in
working directory or in PATH variable directories.

=== Generating of code coverage
Code coverage can be usefull during writing of test or performance profiling. 
We could separate the process into five phases.

1) *Get dependencies*

 # dnf install lcov

2) *Run configure & make*

To allow code to generate statistics, we need to compile it with specific flags.

 $ ./configure CFLAGS="--coverage" LDFLAGS=-lgcov --enable-debug
 $ make

3) *Run code.*

In this phase we should run code. We can run it directly or via test suite.

 $ ./run ./utils/.libs/oscap

4) *Generate and browse results*

 $ lcov -t "OpenSCAP coverage" -o ./coverage.info -c -d .
 $ genhtml -o ./coverage ./coverage.info
 $ xdg-open ./coverage/index.html # open results in browser

5) *Clean stats*

Every run only modify our current statistics and not rewrite them completely.
If we want to generate new statistics, we should remove the old ones.
 
 $ lcov --directory ./ --zerocounters ; find ./ -name "*.gcno" | xargs rm
 $ rm -rf ./coverage

=== Building OpenSCAP for Windows (cross-compilation)
Building OpenSCAP for Windows without a POSIX emulation layer is currently not
possible. However, we are close to a native port of OpenSCAP for Windows. If you
want to help us solve the remaining problems. Instructions for cross-compiling
OpenSCAP for Windows:

1) Install the cross-compiler & dependencies

-------------------------------------------------------------
 # yum install mingw32-gcc mingw32-binutils mingw32-libxml2 \
 mingw32-libgcrypt mingw32-pthreads mingw32-libxslt \
 mingw32-curl mingw32-pcre \
 automake autoconf libtool
-------------------------------------------------------------

2) Checkout the portable branch of the OpenSCAP repository

----------------------------------------------------------------------
 $ git clone -b master https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap.git \
 openscap-portable.git
 $ cd openscap-portable.git/
----------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Prepare the build

------------------------------------------------------
 $ ./autogen.sh
 $ mingw32-configure --disable-probes --disable-python
------------------------------------------------------

4) Build!

------------------------------
 $ make -k 2> build-errors.log
------------------------------

5) Inspect build-errors.log for problems

-----------------------------------------------
 $ grep -E '(error:|implicit)' build-errors.log
-----------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
oscap_acquire.c:32:17: fatal error: ftw.h: No such file or directory
rbt_i32.c:36:9: warning: implicit declaration of function 'posix_memalign'
rbt_i64.c:35:9: warning: implicit declaration of function 'posix_memalign'
rbt_str.c:39:9: warning: implicit declaration of function 'posix_memalign'
tailoring.c:200:2: warning: implicit declaration of function 'strverscmp'
oscap-tool.c:37:17: fatal error: ftw.h: No such file or directory
oscap-oval.c:37:17: fatal error: ftw.h: No such file or directory
oscap-info.c:37:26: fatal error: linux/limits.h: No such file or directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

We need to solve the following problems:

1.  No implementation of ```strverscmp``` for Windows
2.  No implementation of ftw API for Windows
3.  Replace posix_memalign with a Windows API equivalent
4.  Get rid of ```linux/limits.h``` dependency on Windows

If you would like to send us a patch solving one of these problems,
please consult the page about
http://open-scap.org/page/Contribute[contributing to the OpenSCAP
project].
