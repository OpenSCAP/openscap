# OpenSCAP

Open Source Security Compliance Solution

## About

The oscap program is a command line tool that allows users to load, scan,
validate, edit, and export SCAP documents.

Homepage of the project is http://www.open-scap.org

Documentation is on http://www.open-scap.org/page/Documentation


## Compilation

Choose *1a* or *1b* depending on whether you want sources from a release tarball or the git repository.

1a) Get a release tarball
```
# replace ${version} with the desired version
wget https://fedorahosted.org/releases/o/p/openscap/openscap-${version}.tar.gz
tar -xzpf openscap-${version}.tar.gz
cd openscap-${version}.tar.gz
```

**OR**

1b) Get fresh sources from git repository and run ./autogen.sh
```
git clone https://github.com/OpenSCAP/openscap.git
cd openscap
./autogen.sh
```
The autoconf, automake, and libtool tools are required to be installed on your system.

2) Run the following commands to build the library:
```
./configure
make
```
Build dependencies:
(some of these can be turned off via configure)
 * libacl-devel
 * libcap-devel
 * libcurl-devel
 * libgcrypt-devel
 * libselinux-devel
 * libxml2-devel
 * libxslt-devel
 * make
 * openldap-devel
 * pcre-devel
 * perl-XML-Parser
 * perl-XML-XPath
 * perl-devel
 * python-devel
 * rpm-devel
 * swig

3) Run library self-checks by executing the following command:
```
make check
```

4) Run the installation procedure by executing the following command:
```
make install
```


## Use cases

### SCAP Content Validation

 * The following example shows how to validate a given source data stream; all components within the data stream are validated (XCCDF, OVAL, OCIL, CPE, and possibly other components):
```
oscap ds sds-validate scap-ds.xml
```


### Scanning

 * To evaluate all definitions within the given OVAL Definition file, run the following command: 
```
oscap oval eval --results oval-results.xml scap-oval.xml
```
*where scap-oval.xml is the OVAL Definition file and oval-results.xml is the OVAL Result file.*

 * To evaluate all definitions from the OVAL component that are part of a particular data stream within a SCAP data stream collection, run the following command: 
```
oscap oval eval --datastream-id ds.xml --oval-id xccdf.xml --results oval-results.xml scap-ds.xml
```
*where ds.xml is the given data stream, xccdf.xml is an XCCDF file specifying the OVAL component, oval-results.xml is the OVAL Result file, and scap-ds.xml is a file representing the SCAP data stream collection.*

 * To evaluate a specific profile in an XCCDF file run this command: 
```
oscap xccdf eval --profile Desktop --results xccdf-results.xml --cpe cpe-dictionary.xml scap-xccdf.xml
```
*where scap-xccdf.xml is the XCCDF document, Desktop is the selected profile from the XCCDF document, xccdf-results.xml is a file storing the scan results, and cpe-dictionary.xml is the CPE dictionary.*

 * To evaluate a specific XCCDF benchmark that is part of a data stream within a SCAP data stream collection run the following command: 
```
oscap xccdf eval --datastream-id ds.xml --xccdf-id xccdf.xml --results xccdf-results.xml scap-ds.xml
```
*where scap-ds.xml is a file representing the SCAP data stream collection, ds.xml is the particular data stream, xccdf.xml is ID of the component-ref pointing to the desired XCCDF document, and xccdf-results.xml is a file containing the scan results.*


### Document generation

 * without XCCDF rules
```
oscap xccdf generate guide XCCDF-FILE > XCCDF-GUIDE-FILE
```

 * with XCCDF rules
```
oscap xccdf generate guide --profile PROFILE XCCDF-FILE > XCCDF-GUIDE-FILE
```

 *  generate report from scanning
```
oscap xccdf generate report XCCDF-RESULT-FILE > XCCDF-REPORT-FILE
```
