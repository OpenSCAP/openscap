/**
 * The oscap_source is low-level structure. The oscap_source shall hold
 * information regarding SCAP file/node needed for further processing by
 * OpenSCAP library.
 *
 * The oscap_source may refer to a DataStream, a component of datastream,
 * an XCCDF or OVAL file, or any other SCAP file. In rare cases it can
 * also refer to a non-XML file, even binary data!
 *
 * The oscap_source is primarily focused to solve problems regarding parsing
 * and serialization of SCAP files. The structure shall not know much about
 * relation to other sources.
 *
 * For handling relations between oscap_sources users are adviced to use
 * ds_sds_session. For example, if the oscap_source originated from DataStream
 * file there may be other oscap_sources that represent the components of
 * DataStream. These oscap_sources would be managed by ds_sds_session.
 *
 * The oscap_source keeps track of its origin (i.e. XCCDF file may originate
 * by openning an XCCDF file, extracting XCCDF section from DataStream or
 * by evaluation.
 *
 * The oscap_source is lazy structure, it only does its job when it has to.
 * The structure caches data whenever it is feasible.
