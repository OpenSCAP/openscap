 * The oscap_source may refer to a DataStream, a component of datastream,
 * an XCCDF or OVAL file, or any other SCAP or SCE file.
 *
 * The oscap_source is primarily focused to solve problems regarding parsing
 * and serialization of SCAP files. The structure shall not know much about
 * relation to other sources. The relations between sources should be
 * delegated to oscap_source_set.
 *
 * The oscap_source keeps track of its origin (i.e. XCCDF file may originate
 * by openning an XCCDF file, extracting XCCDF section from DataStream or
 * by evaluation.
 *
 * If oscap_source originated from DataStream there wil be other oscap_sources
 * which will keep track of the datastream descendants.
 *
 * The oscap_source is lazy structure, it only does its job when it has to.
 * The structure caches data whenever it is feasible.
