# Updated FindThreads.cmake that supports pthread-win32
# Downloaded from http://www.vtk.org/Bug/bug_view_advanced_page.php?bug_id=6399

# - This module determines the thread library of the system.
#
# The following variables are set
#  CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT     - the thread library
#  CMAKE_USE_SPROC_INIT       - are we using sproc?
#  CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT - using WIN32 threads?
#  CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT    - are we using pthreads
#  CMAKE_HP_PTHREADS_INIT     - are we using hp pthreads
#
# If use of pthreads-win32 is desired, the following variables
# can be set.
#
#  THREADS_USE_PTHREADS_WIN32 -
#    Setting this to true searches for the pthreads-win32
#    port (since CMake 2.8.0)
#
#  THREADS_PTHREADS_WIN32_EXCEPTION_SCHEME
#      C  = no exceptions (default)
#         (NOTE: This is the default scheme on most POSIX thread
#          implementations and what you should probably be using)
#      CE = C++ Exception Handling
#      SE = Structure Exception Handling (MSVC only)
#      (NOTE: Changing this option from the default may affect
#       the portability of your application.  See pthreads-win32
#       documentation for more details.)
#
#======================================================
# Example usage where threading library
# is provided by the system:
#
#   find_package(Threads REQUIRED)
#   add_executable(foo foo.cc)
#   target_link_libraries(foo ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT})
#
# Example usage if pthreads-win32 is desired on Windows
# or a system provided thread library:
#
#   set(THREADS_USE_PTHREADS_WIN32 true)
#   find_package(Threads REQUIRED)
#   include_directories(${THREADS_PTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR})
#
#   add_executable(foo foo.cc)
#   target_link_libraries(foo ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT})
