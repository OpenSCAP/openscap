OVAL is comprised of the OVAL Language, OVAL Content, and the OVAL Repository. Each is defined below:

* The OVAL Language serves as the framework and vocabulary of OVAL.

* OVAL Content is content written in the OVAL Language. All content written in the OVAL Language is considered OVAL Content.
* The OVAL Repository is a collection of OVAL Content hosted by the Center for Internet Security, Inc. under license from the U.S. DHS. It is the central meeting place for the OVAL Community to discuss, analyze, store, and disseminate OVAL Definitions. Each definition in the OVAL Repository determines whether a specified software vulnerability, configuration issue, program, or patch is present on a system.
