.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose VERBOSITY_LEVEL\fR
.RS
Turn on verbose mode at specified verbosity level. VERBOSITY_LEVEL is one of: DEVEL, INFO, WARNING, ERROR.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-verbose-log-file FILE\fR
.RS
Set filename to write additional information.
.RE

.SH INFO OPERATIONS
.TP
[\fIoptions\fR] any-scap-file.xml
.RS
This module prints information about SCAP content in a file specified on a command line. It determines SCAP content type, specification version, date of creation, date of import and so on. Info module doesn't require any additional operation switch.

For XCCDF or SCAP source data stream files, the info module prints out IDs of incorporated profiles, components, and data streams. These IDs can be used to specify the target for evaluation. Use options --profile, --xccdf-id (or --oval-id), and --datastream-id respectively.
.PP
\fB\-\-fetch-remote-resources\fR
.RS
Allow download of remote components referenced from data stream.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-local-files DIRECTORY\fR
.RS
Instead of downloading remote data stream components from the network, use data stream components stored locally as files in the given directory. In place of the remote data stream component OpenSCAP will attempt to use a file whose file name is equal to @name attribute of the uri element within the catalog element within the component-ref element in the data stream if such file exists.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-profile PROFILE\fR
.RS
Show info of the profile with the given ID.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-profiles\fR
.RS
Show profiles from the input file in the <id>:<title> format, one line per profile.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-references\fR
.RS
Show list of references available in each benchmark.
.RE

.SH XCCDF OPERATIONS
.TP
.B \fBeval\fR [\fIoptions\fR] INPUT_FILE [\fIoval-definitions-files\fR]
.RS
Perform evaluation of XCCDF document file given as INPUT_FILE. Print result of each rule to standard output, including rule title, rule id and security identifier(CCE). Optionally you can give an SCAP source data stream as the INPUT_FILE instead of an XCCDF file (see --datastream-id).
.PP
oscap returns 0 if all rules pass. If there is an error during evaluation, the return code is 1. If there is at least one rule with either fail or unknown result, oscap finishes with return code 2.
.PP
.PP
Unless --skip-validation is used, the INPUT_FILE is validated using XSD schemas (depending on document type of INPUT_FILE) and rejected if invalid.
.PP
You may specify OVAL Definition files as the last parameter, XCCDF evaluation will then proceed only with those specified files. Otherwise, when \fIoval-definitions-files\fR parameter is missing, oscap tool will try to load all OVAL Definition files referenced from XCCDF automatically (search in the same path as XCCDF).
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-profile PROFILE\fR
.RS
Select a particular profile from XCCDF document. If "(all)" is given a virtual profile that selects all groups and rules will be used.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-rule RULE\fR
.RS
Select a particular rule from XCCDF document. Only this rule will be evaluated. Any other rules required by this rule won't be evaluated. Rule will use values according to the selected profile. If no profile is selected, default values are used. This option can be used multiple times to specify multiple rules at once.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-skip-rule RULE\fR
.RS
Skip a particular rule from XCCDF document. This option can be used multiple times to skip multiple rules at once.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-reference NAME:IDENTIFIER\fR
.RS
Evaluate rules matching the given reference. This option can be used to check for evaluating compliance with a particular policy requirement. Rules that match the reference will be evaluated, other rules will be skipped and a result of notselected will be returned. The argument needs to be provided in the form NAME:IDENTIFIER (colon is a separator), where NAME is the reference name used as a text of xccdf:reference elements that are child of xccdf:Benchmark element and IDENTIFIER is a text of xccdf:reference element that is child of a particular xccdf:Rule element which has the same @href value as the xccdf:reference element of the NAME value. This feature requires SCAP content to be formed in the aforementioned way. For example: --reference "cis:4.1.3.19", --reference "anssi:BP28(R29)"
List of references available in the given benchmark can be obtained by running the oscap info --references command.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-tailoring-file TAILORING_FILE\fR
.RS
Use given file for XCCDF tailoring. Select profile from tailoring file to apply using --profile. If both --tailoring-file and --tailoring-id are specified, --tailoring-file takes priority.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-tailoring-id COMPONENT_REF_ID\fR
.RS
Use tailoring component in input source data stream for XCCDF tailoring. The tailoring component must be specified by its Ref-ID (value of component-ref/@id attribute in input source data stream). Select profile from tailoring component to apply using --profile. If both --tailoring-file and --tailoring-id are specified, --tailoring-file takes priority.
.RE
