.SH INFO OPERATIONS
.TP
[\fIoptions\fR] any-scap-file.xml
.RS
This module prints information about SCAP content in a file specified on a command line. It determines SCAP content type, specification version, date of creation, date of import and so on. Info module doesn't require any additional opperation switch.

For XCCDF or Datastream files, info module prints out IDs of incorporated profiles, components, and datastreams. These IDs can be used to specify the target for evaluation. Use options --profile, --xccdf-id (or --oval-id), and --datastream-id respectively.
.PP
\fB\-\-fetch-remote-resources\fR
.RS
Allow download of remote components referenced from Datastream.
.RE
.SH XCCDF OPERATIONS
.TP
.B \fBeval\fR [\fIoptions\fR] INPUT_FILE [\fIoval-definitions-files\fR]
.RS
Perform evaluation of XCCDF document file given as INPUT_FILE. Print result of each rule to standard output, including rule title, rule id and security identifier(CVE, CCE). Optionally you can give a source datastream as the INPUT_FILE instead of an XCCDF file (see --datastream-id).
.PP
oscap returns 0 if all rules pass. If there is an error during evaluation, the return code is 1. If there is at least one rule with either fail or unknown result, oscap-scan finishes with return code 2.
.PP
.PP
Unless --skip-valid is used, the INPUT_FILE is validated using XSD schemas (depending on document type of INPUT_FILE) and rejected if invalid.
.PP
You may specify OVAL Definition files as the last parameter, XCCDF evaluation will then proceed only with those specified files. Otherwise, when \fIoval-definitions-files\fR parameter is missing, oscap tool will try to load all OVAL Definition files referenced from XCCDF automatically (search in the same path as XCCDF).
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-profile PROFILE\fR
.RS
Select a particular profile from XCCDF document.
.RE
.TP

The \fIwhat\fR part is a comma-separated list of result types to display in addition to the default. If result type is prefixed by a dash '-', it will be excluded from the results. If \fIwhat\fR is prefixed by an equality sign '=', a following list specifies exactly what rule types to include in the report. Result types are: pass, fixed, notchecked, notapplicable, notselected, informational, unknown, error, fail.
.TP
\fB\-\-oval-template \fItemplate-string\fR
To use the ability to include additional information from OVAL in xccdf result file, a template which will be used to obtain OVAL result file names has to be specified. The template can be either a filename or a string containing wildcard character (percent sign '%'). Wildcard will be replaced by the original OVAL definition file name as referenced from the XCCDF file. This way it is possible to obtain OVAL information even from XCCDF documents referencing several OVAL files. To use this option with results from an XCCDF evaluation, specify \fI%.result.xml\fR as a OVAL file name template.
.TP
\fB\-\-sce-template \fItemplate-string\fR
To use the ability to include additional information from SCE in XCCDF result file, a template which will be used to obtain SCE result file names has to be specified.

This way it is possible to obtain SCE information even from XCCDF documents referencing several SCE files. To use this option with results from an XCCDF evaluation, specify \fI%.result.xml\fR as a SCE file name template.
