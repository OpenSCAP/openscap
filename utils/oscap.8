.SH INFO OPERATIONS
.TP
any-scap-file.xml
.RS
This module prints information about SCAP content in a file specified on a command line. It determines SCAP content type, specification version, date of creation, date of import and so on. Info module doesn't require any additional opperation switch.

For XCCDF or Datastream files, info module prints out IDs of incorporated profiles, components, and datastreams. These IDs can be used to specify the target for evaluation. Use options --profile, --xccdf-id (or --oval-id), and --datastream-id respectively.
.SH XCCDF OPERATIONS
.TP
.B \fBeval\fR [\fIoptions\fR] INPUT_FILE [\fIoval-definitions-files\fR]
.RS
Perform evaluation of XCCDF document file given as INPUT_FILE. Print result of each rule to standard output, including rule title, rule id and security identifier(CVE, CCE). Optionally you can give a source datastream as the INPUT_FILE instead of an XCCDF file (see --datastream-id).
.PP
oscap returns 0 if all rules pass. If there is an error during evaluation, the return code is 1. If there is at least one rule with either fail or unknown result, oscap-scan finishes with return code 2.
.PP
.PP
Unless --skip-valid is used, the INPUT_FILE is validated using XSD schemas (depending on document type of INPUT_FILE) and rejected if invalid.
.PP
You may specify OVAL Definition files as the last parameter, XCCDF evaluation will then proceed only with those specified files. Otherwise, when \fIoval-definitions-files\fR parameter is missing, oscap tool will try to load all OVAL Definition files referenced from XCCDF automatically (search in the same path as XCCDF).
.PP
.TP
\fB\-\-profile PROFILE\fR
.RS
Select a particular profile from XCCDF document.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-tailoring-file TAILORING_FILE\fR

.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-tailoring-id COMPONENT_ID\fR

Use component of given ID (in input source datastream) for XCCDF tailoring. If both --tailoring-file and --tailoring-id are specified, --tailoring files takes priority!
.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-cpe CPE_FILE\fR

.RE
.TP
\fB\-\-benchmark-id ID\fR
.RS
Selects a component ref from any datastream that references a component with XCCDF Benchmark such that its @id attribute matches given string exactly. Please note that this is not the recommended way of selecting a component-ref.

\fB\-\-show \fIwhat\fR
Specify what result types shall be displayed in the result report. The default is to show everything except for rules with results notselected and notapplicable. The \fIwhat\fR part is a comma-separated list of result types to display in addition to the default. If result type is prefixed by a dash '-', it will be excluded from the results. If \fIwhat\fR is prefixed by an equality sign '=', a following list specifies exactly what rule types to include in the report. Result types are: pass, fixed, notchecked, notapplicable, notselected, informational, unknown, error, fail.
.TP
\fB\-\-oval-template \fItemplate-string\fR
To use the ability to include additional information from OVAL in xccdf result file, a template which will be used to obtain OVAL result file names has to be specified. The template can be either a filename or a string containing wildcard character (percent sign '%'). Wildcard will be replaced by the original OVAL definition file name as referenced from the XCCDF file. This way it is possible to obtain OVAL information even from XCCDF documents referencing several OVAL files. To use this option with results from an XCCDF evaluation, specify \fI%.result.xml\fR as a OVAL file name template.

Template to be used to generate the script. If it contains a dot '.' it is interpreted as a location of a file with the template definition. Otherwise it identifies a template from standard set which currently includes: \fIbash\fR (default if no --template switch present). Brief explanation of the process of writing your own templates is in the XSL file \fIxsl/legacy-fix.xsl\fR in the openscap data directory.
